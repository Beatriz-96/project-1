## Description:
Chubby Buddies is a obstacle jumping game inspired by the dinosaur game from Google, but with some twists!
<br>
The story of the game consists in three friends (our Chubbies) that are best buddies! They love to run together and see the flowers. 
<br>
To avoid stepping on them they have to jump! Flying around the flowers that are some bugs and ballons that our Buddies are afraid of, so they will jump to avoid them too!



<br>

## Instructions:
The game is simple! You need to PRESS 1 or 2, depending on which obstacle you pretend to jump.
<br>
If you want to jump the flowers, press 1. To avoid the bugs and balloons you press 2.
<br>
At the start you have three(3) lives (1 Chubby = 1 life). If you hit the obstacle you lose the Chubby that hit it and one life.
